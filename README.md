# DCL-Hackathon
Typescript code from 5 scenes from the Decentraland Conference Center prototpye.  This typescript was written during the Hackathon, by way of manual conversion of previous A-Frame markup.  (c) 2019 by Carl Fravel
These scenes can be seen (at least for awhile) at https://client.decentraland.today/?position=-14%2C137 if you have a Decentraland invitational alpha client access token in your MetaMask wallet.
